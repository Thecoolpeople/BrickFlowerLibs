# BrickFlowerLibs
Libraries for the BrickFlower Engine

## Installation
When you want to use all Libraries, just download the [0build.js](0build/0build.js) file from the repo. You can rename it if you want. Then copy the file into your project and include it.

If you just want to use just specific libs, just go inthe the [0build(0build/) folder and download the file you want. The way to install the library is just the same as above!

## Testing
Just click on a link an you get to the testing file in the folder directly in your browser!
